Welcome to FlayrOS
===================


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with FlayrOS, you'll need to get familiar with
[Git and Repo](https://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the Slim6 trees, use this command:


	repo init -u git://github.com/TeamFlex/manifest.git -b flayrmm



Then sync up with this command:

	repo sync
